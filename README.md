# Countdown

This software can be used as a visual timer. It was initially developed to display the time left before the end of an exam.

## How to use

The web page is located at [this GitHub page](https://steevedroz.github.io/countdown).

Clicking of the title *Countdown* enables the user to rename the countdown (for instance to: "Time left for the exam").

Choosing a time in *HH:MM:SS* (all fields being facultative and replaced by 0 if empty) and then pressing on *Start* will display the time left as a portion of a blue circle.

While in use, pressing *pause* will stop the timer and allow to edit it. It will restart when the *Start* button is pressed again.

Pressing on the *Reset* button at any time will stop the timer, clear the circle and erase the time.

If the timer goes under 0, a negative timer will be displayed in red.
